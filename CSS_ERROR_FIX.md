# ✅ CSS Build Error Fixed!

## 🐛 **Problem**
The build was failing with this error:
```
Transforming CSS failed
Selector "*" is not pure. Pure selectors must contain at least one local class or id.
```

## 🔧 **Root Cause**
CSS Modules (`.module.css` files) require "pure" selectors that contain at least one local class or id. Global selectors like `*`, `button`, `a`, etc. are not allowed in CSS Modules.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### 1. **Cleaned up `page.module.css`**
- Removed all global selectors (`*`, `button`, `a`, etc.)
- Kept only component-specific classes (`.appContainer`, `.placeholderContainer`, etc.)
- Maintained all responsive design features

### 2. **Moved Global Styles to `globals.css`**
- Moved global selectors to the main CSS file where they belong
- Added smooth transitions, focus states, and utility classes
- Maintained all styling improvements

### 3. **Preserved All Features**
- ✅ Responsive design still works perfectly
- ✅ All animations and transitions preserved
- ✅ Mobile-first approach maintained
- ✅ Professional styling intact

## 🚀 **Result**
- ✅ **Build error fixed** - No more CSS transformation errors
- ✅ **Server running** - Application is now accessible at `http://localhost:3002`
- ✅ **All features working** - Responsive design, animations, and styling preserved
